A destructive, fiery left-handed opening batsman from
 New South Wales, David Warner became the first Australian
 cricketer in 132 years to get into the national team without 
playing a first-class game. An outstanding fielder and a hard-hitting batter, 
he was the leading run-scorer in the 2005-06 season when the Australia Under-19s
 toured India. He then proceeded to play the Under-19 World Cup.
